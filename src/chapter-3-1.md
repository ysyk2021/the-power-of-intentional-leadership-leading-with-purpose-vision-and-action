Effective intentional leaders are self-aware and continuously seek opportunities for personal growth and development. One way to develop self-awareness is through regular self-reflection. This involves taking time to reflect on your thoughts, feelings, and actions, and identifying areas where you can improve.

Technique 2: Clarify Your Values

To become an intentional leader, it is important to clarify your values and use them as a guide for your decision-making and leadership style. This involves identifying the core values that are most important to you and using these values to set goals and make decisions that align with your personal and professional aspirations.

Technique 3: Set Goals and Create a Plan

Intentional leaders have a clear vision of where they want to go and what they want to achieve. They set ambitious but achievable goals and create a plan to achieve those goals. To develop a clear vision, it is important to consider your personal and professional aspirations, as well as the needs and aspirations of your team or organization.

Technique 4: Develop Strong Interpersonal Skills
