Intentional leadership is a leadership philosophy that focuses on making conscious choices and taking deliberate actions to achieve desired outcomes. It involves leading with purpose, vision, and action, aligning individual and organizational goals, and inspiring others to contribute their best efforts towards a common purpose.

**Components of Intentional Leadership**
----------------------------------------

### 1. Purpose-Driven Leadership

Intentional leadership starts with a clear sense of purpose. Leaders who embrace intentional leadership understand and articulate their personal and organizational purpose. They establish a strong connection between their actions and the underlying purpose, which serves as a guiding compass for decision-making and goal-setting.

### 2. Strategic Vision

Intentional leaders create and communicate a strategic vision that inspires and motivates individuals and teams. They have a compelling vision of the desired future state and can effectively convey it to others. This vision provides direction, clarity, and a shared understanding of where the organization is heading and how to get there.

### 3. Action-Oriented Approach

Intentional leaders take proactive and decisive action to bring their vision to life. They are not passive observers but actively engage in problem-solving, decision-making, and implementation. They set clear goals, develop action plans, and lead by example in executing those plans with determination and accountability.

### 4. Emotional Intelligence and Self-Awareness

Intentional leaders possess a high level of emotional intelligence and self-awareness. They understand their own strengths, weaknesses, and values, which enables them to build authentic connections with others and navigate complex interpersonal dynamics. They empathize with their team members, listen actively, and adapt their leadership style to meet individual needs.

### 5. Ethical and Values-Driven Leadership

Intentional leaders adhere to ethical principles and operate with integrity. They lead by example, embodying the values they expect from others. They make ethical decisions, prioritize the well-being of their team members and stakeholders, and foster a culture of trust, fairness, and respect.
