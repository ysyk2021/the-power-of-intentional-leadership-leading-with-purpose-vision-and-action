Common sources of resistance to intentional leadership may include fear of change, lack of trust, resistance to new ideas, and a lack of clarity or understanding about the organization's purpose and vision. It's essential for intentional leaders to understand these sources of resistance and develop strategies to address them.

Developing Strategies for Overcoming Resistance

Developing strategies for overcoming resistance involves identifying the root causes of resistance, engaging in open and honest communication with team members, promoting a culture of collaboration and inclusion, and addressing any barriers to success that may be impeding progress.

Addressing Fear and Uncertainty

Addressing fear and uncertainty is another key aspect of managing resistance to intentional leadership.

Fostering a growth mindset is also crucial for managing resistance to intentional leadership.
